# Algorithms and Data Structures
---
Project, conducted during "Algorithm and Data Structures" course, consist of implementation of three data structres:
* singly-linked list,
* doubly-linked list,
* AVL tree,

and some algorithms, which helps operating on them.  
The tests are written in [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) test framework.
